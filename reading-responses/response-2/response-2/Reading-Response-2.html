	<h4> 

		In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?
 </h4>



 <p> 

 	When Seu tells us to “defamiliarize our tools” I think she’s telling us to avoid becoming an automated user that pays no attention to our actions across the web. That we should monitor our digital actions the same way we monitor our daily physical actions, because we interact with the digital world consistently throughout our day the same way that we do people. The only difference is instead of walking, talking and speaking, we are clicking, typing and swiping. This relates to her use of the word poetry in the sense that digital poetry speaks to us in a more subconscious form. We don’t monitor this kind of connection because this world doesn’t physically exist. With that being said, in this modern era it is extremely rare that we see an individual who doesn’t interact with the web or digital realm, and by extension we need to question the conscious and meaningful ways that we interact with technology as a tool, a language as a constant factor that creates an understanding of ourselves. Ultimately, how technology and all its branches interact with our daily life in a poetic context.

 <h4> 

 Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.

	After reading through and observing each section, the one I gravitated towards the most was the Production of Errors. The primary reason I loved this poetic tool is because I’m really fascinated by the human factor and this idea of error weather it be through technology, through human factor or by combining the two. The highlighted works uses a combination of human interaction with the digital realm to produce these unique errors that result in a conceptual project that causes you to think about this kind of interaction. This idea that technology, something mathematically designed upon accuracy and perfection, can create an error or glitch the same way a human, unpredictable and self thinking, could produce an error. I find that errors have their own poetry and can be beautiful visually and conceptually. Ultimately my definition for Production of Errors is a process of excepting the beauty of the mistake. Accepting and promoting failure or error in order to further communicate digital poetry, art or something that could be subjective to the user.
