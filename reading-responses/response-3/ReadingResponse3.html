What could your website be?

	While social media such as; Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat etc…are all individual website which people can interact through, they don’t allow for the endless possibilities that specified websites do. The beautiful thing about individual websites is that they’re almost like a rabbit hole that you can fall into. Something that never ends, can always be built and improved upon. Social media is something you can build yourself, but not something that can truly be personalized, regardless of what you upload, these profiles will remain in the original corporation designed format. I do agree with Laurel Schwulst. I myself am not a huge social media fan, this is primarily because when I do tend to use it a fall down a different kind of rabbit hole, one not so creative. A website is something so much more beautiful than social media, something so much more creative and as Schwulst says, can even parallel or juxtaposition social medias. Websites are open spaces ready for any design you choose to create, social media lives still, a place where you can post these creations but never interact or transform.

I think a website is like a fire. Once you light it, it starts out small and beautiful. The more wood you give it, the larger it burns, the brighter it gets. When you stop placing the wood on the fire, it begins to die down, however, the embers from that fire are just as beautiful, sometimes even a little more, as the fire was during its peak. A fire also has little spurs, cracks and pops that spray out during its peak, these could act as those smaller ideas you have through the heat of your creative process. While they may not completely contribute directly to the larger idea in action, these little pops of ideas do show up and usually add to the beauty of the fire. Perhaps one day they could pop out and start a separate fire and thus creating a whole new creative experience.
