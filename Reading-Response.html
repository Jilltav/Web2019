	The Turing Complete User
</a>

<h4>
What do you think is Lialina’s opinion of the word user?
</h4>

<p>
I feel like Lialina’s opinion on the word user is that it should not become invisible as others suggest. She mentions that as we move forward, in regards to Don Norman’s coined term “UX” in 1995, in 2012, designers begin to avoid the use of this term, since they are not designing for users but instead designing for people. Lialina quickly addresses that there needs to be a clear distinction between the word user and the word people. People is far too general to associate between the person, the user, the programmer and so forth. She best describes this when she states “Being a User is the last reminder that there is, whether invisible or not, a computer, is a programmed system you use.” While the computer continues to evolve to become something that will eventually be invisible, we must remember to identify ourselves as the user in control of the program. Moving forward she also states that the invention of the computer did not start with the computer itself, but its effect on the user and how it would fit into our habits. She uses the example of a system called Memex, during this release, Bush spends more time explaining how the user would interact with the system, rather than the system itself, placing the focal point on the user. She even expresses the difference between various users; those who are creative, the “too busy” and the Turing complete user. Realistically, those who are more creative are more inclined to want to understand the program, or at least its function. The Turing user is one who realizes the full potential of said program and begins to experiment with the multi uses it could have rather than the singular uses its designed for. She explains the experience as the ultimate experience. Lastly, there is the general user, or the “too busy” user. This is the one who acknowledges the singular use which a program is designed for and has no strive to understand how their experience could be more effective/efficient. They are essentially just “too busy” to look into things.

<h5>
What is Lialinas ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines
</h5>

<p> 
Lialina’s ideal internet user is the universal user, or the Turing complete user. Essentially she describes this individual as one who does not look for specifically programmed apps to dictate their singular uses. The kind of user that understands the multi use of a program. One that understands how these kinds of things function and can therefore use programs and applications more efficiently in comparison to the “too busy” user. She wants users to identify the ultimate experience by not seeing singular application as the programs they’re designed to be, but look for the potential they hold in a grander scheme. Lialina describes, “computer users are Turing complete”. I understood this as the kind of user that knows we need to understand to program before we become programmed. Furthermore, I feel like her ideal user is also the creative user. Most of the time in order to break out of that “too busy” mindset, you need to think from a different perspective. As a graphic designer we are taught to analyze the smaller details, not just from a graphic perspective but typographically, conceptually and so forth. We need to understand every aspect of the piece; object or project we are creating. Reflecting on this mindset of paying attention to detail, this idea of diving into code is just one step further into the details, the ones we don’t physically see. We are enhancing our design experience.

<h6>
From your own experiences on the web, what is an example where there are gaps that can be filled by the users?
</h6>

<p>
Reflecting on my own experience, I can say that there’s a lot of things I still don’t understand about how I interact with programs. This article made me open my eyes a little to see that as a user its very important. Much like checking your surroundings in real life, that you need to do the same when using any application. This idea of understanding how the code works, how the program functions, will ultimately better your experience with the program. The gaps that need to be filled are in regards to the connection between the program and user. As Lialina explains, there is a disconnect between her ideal user, and the “too busy” user. Essentially, users in general interact with programs for their designed intent, but are unable to explore their full potential since they have no desire to push the limits. The largest gap is this “too busy” user, I think there is a certain level of importance in understanding the thing you’re using, the same way you purchase products or interact with the people you value, this is all because you understand how the product or person functions and therefore decide to purchase/develop a relationship. I think what we can do to fill this gap is to take an interest, or just in general try to educate ourselves on the things we use on a day to day basis, even the things we can’t always see.
